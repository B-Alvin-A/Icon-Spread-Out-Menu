# Icon-Spread-Out-Menu
This is a HTML/CSS/JS code for creating an "Icon Spread Out Menu".

The menu consists of a central button with an expand icon, and four secondary buttons with icons and titles. When the central button is clicked, the secondary buttons spread out from it and become visible. The icons and titles of the secondary buttons also animate on hover.

The code uses the following technologies:

HTML: for creating the structure of the menu.
CSS: for styling the menu, including the positioning, sizing, colors, transitions, and animations of the buttons and icons.
JavaScript: for adding interactivity to the menu, including toggling the visibility and animation of the secondary buttons when the central button is clicked.

The code also uses the Ionicons library to provide the icons used in the menu. The library is loaded from the unpkg.com CDN using a script tag with the "module" and "nomodule" attributes, which provide support for both modern browsers and older ones.

Overall, this code demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and interactive menu that can be used in a web application or website.
